Okay Okay, It's not a movie but you're a wonder to watch. <br> <br>
You know, the fashion in which you were designed, I dare say, there's just one other person designed like that. And them never born am yet.
It's not a gainsay that the true test of a person's credibility and strength is the ability to weather storm and come out of it like AQUAMAN.
You my, dear, makes Aquaman tremble to his knees. Your awesomeness is uncanny, definitely one for the books. I mean, the many books that will have to be written about you. </p>
<br>
<p class="mesage2">
I know I said it's not a movie but I think Gal Gadot was wrongly casted for the movie "WONDER WOMAN", (Have you seen the movie?) they missed you, by a great inch.<br>
But do I blame them? tch! <br>
They don't have the fortitude to dig in deeper for a gem like you. <br>
So let's forgive them, their loss.<br>
But to me, and to the many people whose eyes can accurately see, you, are a WONDER WOMAN!
</p>

The way your mind is framed is a wonder, <br>
The strength of your character, a wonder, <br>
Your wisdom, like a sage, a wonder. <br>
your intelligence.. a super wonder. <br> However, nothing is more WONDERful than how you commit to whatever or whoever you set your mind to. <br> 
How you go all the way, out of your way, knocking all walls down to show that commitment isn't just a giggle you make in front of the CAMERA, its an ACTION you take when the LIGHTS are off. <br>

I am not doing this out of reciprocity or any of that sort, but I'm doing it out of gratefulness, appreciation and all the love I have to give. Too bad I'm rich at the moment, I had plans for this day, but oh well.. <br>

<p>
    I happen to be the kind of person who doesn‚Äôt believe much in coincidences. Instead, I believe in those ‚Äúcoincidences‚Äù occurring to meet a particular purpose. And that purpose was what led to December 26th 2022, where two beings would meet and have both good and bad experiences, whichled to this day. 
<br>
I must say, God took extra time to create you because (and I won‚Äôt lie) you have, in many ways dropped my jaw wide open in awe with the kind of personality you possess.  <br>
I honestly don‚Äôt know where to start within this short period (I just started this writing yesterday! omo!) but I have to just start somewhere I guess.. or I have even started already? smh ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
<br>
Let me start (or continue) with your willingness to contribute to collectively achieve something. Before everything between us went down the drain, your dedication to a target of us reading a few books for the year was something I don‚Äôt take for granted. It was a part of me I was looking forward to start, now guess who has a whole library?  So yeah, THANK YOU! <br> I hope you‚Äôve read that shepherd's wife I got for you the other time by the way? 
<br>
Romola, you‚Äôre a FAITH being! Damn!<br> How could I forget your support all through my worst times, assuring me that nothing bad would happen to me when my boss started his drama about wanting me to fade into oblivion. You even almost went to court with me. Nobody encouraged me as much as you did, you assured me that the matter would die of a natural cause and I held on to this every time. I walked into the court with confidence that nothing happens today, because Romola said so.  And gradually, the matter truly died down. Super amazing. 
<br>
How can I forget your super delicious Sunday stir fry spaghetti! Nah I‚Äôd never go hungry because Romola wouldn‚Äôt let that happen. It‚Äôs always ‚Äúwhat are you going to eat after church!?‚Äù üòÇ <br> I wish I could have one more of that every sunday lol... It is well.
<br>
Or should I talk about the times you woke me up to tell me about us practicing faith by going to car stands to price cars in faith. I just sat down watching you explain the process, and all I had going on on my mind was‚Ä¶ What a creation! Oh what a creator! <br> God dey create abeg! üòÇ
<br>
Although you dismissed my health issues because you believed it was of irrelevance, but subsequent actions (especially that of May 18) that I don‚Äôt want to talk about- made me look into it and slowly; but progressively, I‚Äôve been getting help. Thank you. 
<br>

Thank you for modelling with my clothes. Especially that grey one. I should hang it inside one frame FR ü§£
<br>
Thank you for your endless compliments about me looking good in shirts. I don't talk but those words get to me like mad ü§£ <br><br>

Thank you of course, for reminding me that I am a frontend developer... I'm not sure you know this about me. This write up made me dust my cding software lol.
<br>
Thank you for proving Myles Munroe wrong when he said Nobody cares about me, because you did, more than I could imagine.<br>

Man! There‚Äôs a lot to thank you for, but there isn‚Äôt much resources for it but I believe God would help me thank you. I sent my birthday voice notes to a friend and the thing he said about you while listening to that your voice note ehn‚Ä¶ hmmm
</p>
Everything you have done from the day I met you has affected me one way or the other and  I appreciate it all. I wouldn't trade it in the world.
<br>
I know you won't believe it but everything you have said and done to me, affets me either positively or negatively, I just do not know what to say or how to say it most times, so I keep mute. but I appreciate it all, I promise! Thank you so much!
<br>

I hope you still like groundnts? <br>
Why don't you wear wigs though? I think it'll look good on you. <br>Just a thought though... 

Another gift I couldn't add to the box: A Treat. <br> Pick a date, pick a day, you will be going for a dinner (or lunch, whatever).
 Just let me know when, and send the bill. <br>

There are 364 other days to say all I have days to say all that I have said, but your birthday is a perfect chance to reiterate them!

so here is me wishing you a Happy Birthday, My <span id="olutade">Omo Olutade De-johnson!</span>
Love, always ‚ù§Ô∏è

            <h5>Did we really have any Memorable Moments?</h5>
            It's crazy how we were more than friends for that long while and we never really spent much time going out and making memorable moments, and the times we went, there are no pictoral evidence, hence we can not exactly say we had those memorable moments, hence the memories would remain in the head and heart until it fades away... smh <br> I will blame this largely on you because you hate pictures. Never met a weirder person... smh... 
            <br>
            Anyways... this space would remain empty because I do not have "decent" enough picture to place here. The only one I have can NEVER be posted here. Never. <br><br>

            I should just write a little prayer here, even though my heart is filled with love now that I don't know what to even pray about,
             but Whenever I remember the 30 Minutes long voicenote you sent praying for me, I just want to bless you with words.
              I may not be as good as you are at talking or expressing, plus I am not sure my voice note would be welcoming but 
              know my heart prays for you every time, without a reservation...

            I hope this doesn't put me in trouble, but I just have to do it, though with moderation <br> This was not my plan, but you frustrated the plan I had for this birthday. <br>
            All you had to do was accept to "take me" out. That's all! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è <br>

            I have a weird way of showing it but I love you wholehearedly, and without hestitation, and I wish the best for you in all your endeavors.
            Regardless of our fallout, you still hold one of the biggest impacts in my life. Thank you.
